# SQL---World-Populations-I
This project is part of Codecademy course on SQL. In this project, I answered a set of questions using a database of world population by country. The following files are:

1) Powerpoint presentation - My analysis being communicated to the audience.
2) The excel file - My detail analysis in tables and graphs forms.
3) The SQL file - My queries used in generating the data to be analyzed. 
4) The database file is in .sqlite format. It can be opened using "DB Browser." 

Note that after opening the database file (.sqlite) using the DB Browser, you can also copy and paste the queries file (SQL file) in the "Execute SQL" tab to see the reuslts of each queries.
